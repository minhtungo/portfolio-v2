                From the moment I produced {'"'}Hello World{'"'} in the console
                of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of
                web development. It has never been {'"'}just a job{'"'} for me,
                it{"'"}s offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and
                improve my skills in creating high-quality websites. What
                started with a simple
                {'"'}Hello World{'"'} has become a passion.

                I am a web developer with experience building web apps with
                HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Nodes.js, Express and MongoDB. I
                am focused on being a valuable part of any team I am on and
                believe in the team rising together. I love working with
                dedicated teams to build efficient and robust applications
                suited to the user{"'"}s needs. Currently, I am looking for an
                opportunity to continuously learn, grow and make positive
                contributions to the company.
