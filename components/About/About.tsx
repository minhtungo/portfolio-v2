              From the moment I produced "Hello World" in the console of my
              first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of web
              development. It has never been "just a job" for me, it's offered
              an engaging challenge to continually learn and improve my skills
              in creating high-quality websites. What started with a simple
              "Hello World" has become a full-fledged passion.

              I am a web developer with experience building web apps with HTML,
              CSS, Javascript, React, Nodes.js, Express and MongoDB. I am
              focused on being a valuable part of any team I am on and believe
              in the team rising together. I love working with dedicated teams
              to build efficient and robust applications suited to the user's
              needs. Currently, I am looking for an opportunity to continuously
              learn, grow and make positive contributions to the company.
