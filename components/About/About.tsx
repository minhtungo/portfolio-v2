                From the moment I produced {'"'}Hello World{'"'} in the console
                of my first application, I knew I was hooked into the world of
                web development. It has never been {'"'}just a job{'"'} for me,
                it{"'"}s offered an engaging challenge to continually learn and
                improve my skills in creating high-quality websites. What
                started with a simple
                {'"'}Hello World{'"'} has become a passion.
